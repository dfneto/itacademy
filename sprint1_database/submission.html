<h1>Ex 1 - About the database MOVIES </h1>

Recording that each id is unique in a table and is used to represent a register in a table and for this reason all the tables have an id column.
<h3>tb_movie</h3>
movie_id: it is the id of the movie<br>
movie_title: movie's title<br>
movie_date: released movie's date<br>
movie_format: can be Film or Digital<br>
movie_genre_id: this is a foreign key to the table tb_genre, it means that to this column must have one (and just one) of the ids of the tb_genre. And an id of tb_genre cab be associated to many movies (relation 1:N)<br>

<h3>tb_genre</h3>
genre_id: it is the id of the table and used as foreign key to tb_movie<br> genre_name: is the name of the genre

<h3>tb_role</h3>
role_id: it is the id of the table and used as foreign key to <br>
role_name: name of the role, like actor, director etc. <br>

<h3>tb_person</h3>
From now on it will be explained just the fields that represent a relation between the tables, it means, the foreign keys.<br>
person_parent_id: is a foreign key to the same table (tb_person) meaning the father of the person. In this database, a person can have one or none father. And a person can be father of many people.

<h3>tb_movie_person</h3>
This table indicates if a person, worked in a specific movie and in a specific role, was indicated to an award. So, this table will have 3 columns with a foreign key to the three tables related (tb_person, tb_movie, tb_role).<br>
movie_id: it is an id of tb_movie.<br>
person_id: it is an id of the tb_person. <br>
role_id: it is an id of the tb_role. <br>
In this table, the primary key is the set of these 3 values.



<h3> Ex 2: </h3>

    select person_name , person_country , person_dob  from tb_person tp where person_dod IS NULL order by person_dob; 
<h3> Ex 3: </h3>

    SELECT  tg.genre_name , COUNT(*) AS total_movies
    FROM tb_movie tm 
    JOIN tb_genre tg ON tm.movie_genre_id = tg.genre_id 
    GROUP BY tm.movie_genre_id 
    ORDER BY total_movies DESC 
<h3> Ex 4: </h3>


    -- Starting from this query it's easier to understand the final query
    SELECT tm.movie_title, tp.person_name, tr.role_name 
    FROM tb_movie_person tmp 
    JOIN tb_person tp ON tmp.person_id = tp.person_id 
    JOIN tb_role tr  ON tmp.role_id = tr.role_id 
    JOIN tb_movie tm ON tmp.movie_id = tm.movie_id 
    ORDER BY tm.movie_title, tp.person_name

    -- Final query
    SELECT tp.person_name, count(DISTINCT tr.role_name)
    FROM tb_movie_person tmp 
    JOIN tb_person tp ON tmp.person_id = tp.person_id 
    JOIN tb_role tr  ON tmp.role_id = tr.role_id 
    JOIN tb_movie tm ON tmp.movie_id = tm.movie_id 
    GROUP BY tp.person_name
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT tr.role_name) > 1

<h3> Ex 5 </h3>

    INSERT INTO movies.tb_genre 
    (genre_id, genre_name) 
    VALUES(69, 'Documentary')

<h3> Ex 6 </h3>

    DELETE from tb_movie_person tmp where tmp.movie_id = 11

    DELETE FROM movies.tb_movie
